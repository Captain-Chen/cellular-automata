# Conway's Game of Life
An implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` or [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/captain-chen/pen/MObVzE) in your browser.
2. Click on any cells to toggle it "on" or "off". Depending on how many neighboring cells are "on" will determine whether or not that cell "lives" onto the next cycle or generation. See [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Rules) for more details.
3. When you are satisfied with your initial pattern, click `Start` to run the simulation automatically or `Next Cycle` to see the following result after one generation.
   * If you are unsure of a pattern to use, you can click `Random` or `Gosper Glider Gun` before starting the simulation.
4. Clicking on `Reset` will set the board to a blank slate and reset the generation counter.
